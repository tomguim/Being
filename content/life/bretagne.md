In 2019 I went to study and live for a year in Lorient Bretagne. There, among the Senegalese Community, I am named Ghili Bi Fao Ka Kao...

Its a port city right on the Ocean and you really get the feel of a Sailor Culture.

Here you can see Morgane and Lucie at the Triangle wearing our customary sailing hat! (It's really an aviator hat, but we just play pretend)

I was studying Ecological and Sociological Science and I met some really cool people along the way.  Here's a photo of some of my classmates and friends (Virginie, Mathias, and PJ)!

Yec'hed mat! Meaning "Cheers" is something we would say every time while drinking! And my lord do Bretons drink!
Lorient has more bars per square kilometer than any city in France!

We would spend most nights out at either friends appartments, the beach, the navy ship, the triangle, or going clubbing.

My friend Martin, really an incredible guy. Changed my life in a lot of ways. Can't wait to see him again!

Here I made a friend Pierre Jean (PJ), we did a lot together! Recently we have lost contact and that saddens me, but he definately made my stay in Lorient very memorable.

Here we have PJ, Killian, Tom and Matthias. Killian is a really cool guy and a great surfer/wakeboarder! Can't wait to see him again!

With my friend Matthias, I took MMA classes. We got our assess beat each session! But it was a lot of fun and we were honestly getting a lot better. I was always paired against this one black belt who was three times my size haha

These photos were actually taken on the navy ship (Noe) in the military base. We would sneek onto the base and into the boat and we would throw parties there until 4 in the morning! Here Matthias is the man of the party for having traversed a metal chain the length of a football elevated 3 stories above the ocean between a poll and the boat, with no clothes and in the wind. Mindblowing!

I met Lucile at a Raggae bar while out dancing with Virginie! She had an MSU sweatshirt on! And what a coincidence she had lived in the US just 10 minutes away from my house!!!
She knew about the Franklin Cider Mill and even the Corn Maze at Bowers Farm!

My favorite memory of us is when we climbed the rocks and swam in the ocean to get to a secret cove! Such a great day! I look forward to seeing her again
She is the one who introduced me to painting and we took Oil Painting Classes together.

This was the first painting I made of her (she says I made her look like a neandrethal haha)

In the art class this was my first painting.

Lucile, Martin, Virginie, Antoine, Nathan and I also love rock climbing! I would go rock climbing with them twice a week! It was through rock climbing that I met Antoine and Nathan, two really cool guys who also like motorcycling!

I definately learned a lot while I was in Bretagne, searching for who I am and what I want to do with my life. It was a place of adventure and self-discovery. I sincerely thank all the people I met and friends who made my time there so memorable.

I owe you the moon...
Kenavo Breizh! You will be missed!
