The Police Helicopter flying right over our heads as we crouch behind the peak of the dunes. Police Boats and helicopters were searching the area, we always had one person on scout with binoculars! Thrilling and honestly I have never felt more free.

The second painting is the view from our hammock.

Coconut Rum by the ocean! Reminds me of Hawaii! A bottle of this rum is always a good friend to near death experiences haha
