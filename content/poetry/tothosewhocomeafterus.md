Truly, I live in dark times...
An artless word is foolish. A smooth forehead
Points to insensitivity. He who laughs
Has not yet received
The terrible news.

What times are these, in which
A conversation about trees is almost a crime
For in doing so we maintain our silence about so much wrongdoing!
And he who walks quietly across the street,
Passes out of the reach of his friends
Who are in danger?

It is true: I work for a living
But, believe me, that is a coincidence.
Nothing that I do gives me the right to satisfy my hunger.
By chance I have been spared. (If my luck does not hold, I am lost.)

They tell me: eat and drink. Be happy to have what you have!
But how can I eat and drink
When I take what I eat from the starving
And my glass of water from those dying of thirst?
And yet I eat and drink.

I would also like to be wise.
In the old books it is said what wisdom is:
To retreat from the strife of the world
To live out the brief time that is your lot
Without fear
To make your way without violence
To repay evil with good —
The wise do not seek to satisfy their desires,
But to forget them.

But all of this is rendered impossible for me…
Truly, I live in dark times...

II

I came into the cities in a time of disorder
As hunger reigned.
I came among men in a time of turmoil
And I rose up with them.
And so passed
The time given to me on earth.

I ate my food between slaughters.
I laid down to sleep among murderers.
I tended to love with abandon.
I looked upon nature with impatience.
And so passed
The time given to me on earth.

In my time streets led into a swamp.
My language betrayed me to the slaughterer.
There was little I could do. But without me
the rulers sat more securely, or so I hoped.
And so passed

The time given to me on earth.
Our powers were so limited. The goal
Lay far in the distance
It could clearly be seen although even I
Could hardly hope to reach it.
And so passed
The time given to me on earth.

III

You, who shall resurface following the flood
In which we have perished,
Contemplate —
When you speak of our weaknesses,
Also the dark time
That you have escaped.

For we went forth, changing our country more frequently than our shoes
Through the class warfare, despairing
That there was only injustice and no outrage.
And yet we knew:
Even the hatred of lowliness
Distorts one’s features.

Even anger against injustice
Makes the voice grow hoarse.
We who wished to lay the foundation for gentleness
Could not ourselves be gentle.

But you, when at last the time comes
That man is a helper to fellow man,
Should think upon us
With leniency.

- Bertolt Brecht

A poem by Bertolt Brecht translated from German. Slight changes in translation made by Tom Guimberteau.  The original poem is titled “An die Nachgeborenen”
