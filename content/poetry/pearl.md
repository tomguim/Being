From my vantage,
I quietly listen to her beautiful music that she plays so intently.
The sun is mirrored through her eyes with glowing gleaming intensity.
They sparkle; flickering to a music of their own making.

In her eyes I see everything that is human.
In the white flames I see Art and Creativity,
Hopes and Frustrations,
Ideas both realized and fruitless,
Like Kino’s pearl on the surface of her eyes I can see dreams form.

The notes enter her mind and leave through her hands.
But something stays behind…
Ideas which are so beautiful they cannot be expressed simply because we have no words for them.
Ideas so lonely. What more saddening than a thought which cannot be expressed?

Perhaps, it is through music, art, and dance we hope to express these sentiments.
In a language more abstract yet all the more detailed that we hope to speak and be heard.
To be noted and understood.
To belong.

For what use is it to write of her eyes when their qualities can not be written!
In them lie phantoms of vision and dream. All dancing to their own song.

Beyond depth and color, this poem does little to convey the beauty I found in the sparkle of her eyes.
