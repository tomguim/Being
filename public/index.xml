      <description>Truly, I live in dark times&amp;hellip; An artless word is foolish. A smooth forehead Points to insensitivity. He who laughs Has not yet received The terrible news.
What times are these, in which A conversation about trees is almost a crime For in doing so we maintain our silence about so much wrongdoing! And he who walks quietly across the street, Passes out of the reach of his friends Who are in danger?</description>

      <description>From my vantage, I quietly listen to her beautiful music that she plays so intently. The sun is mirrored through her eyes with glowing gleaming intensity. They sparkle; flickering to a music of their own making.
In her eyes I see everything that is human. In the white flames I see Art and Creativity, Hopes and Frustrations, Ideas both realized and fruitless, Like Kinoâ€™s pearl on the surface of her eyes I can see dreams form.</description>
