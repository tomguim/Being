      <description>Gurvann Lillian and Tom
We took these two photos while on the run!
The Police Helicopter flying right over our heads as we crouch behind the peak of the dunes. Police Boats and helicopters were searching the area, we always had one person on scout with binoculars! Thrilling and honestly I have never felt more free.
The second painting is the view from our hammock.
Coconut Rum by the ocean! Reminds me of Hawaii!</description>

      <description>Plijet bras on oc&amp;rsquo;h ober anaoudegezh ganeoc&amp;rsquo;h! (Meaning &amp;ldquo;Pleased to meet you&amp;rdquo; in Breton - I had to google this haha) In 2019 I went to study and live for a year in Lorient Bretagne. There, among the Senegalese Community, I am named Ghili Bi Fao Ka Kao&amp;hellip;
Its a port city right on the Ocean and you really get the feel of a Sailor Culture. Here you can see Morgane and Lucie at the Triangle wearing our customary sailing hat!</description>
